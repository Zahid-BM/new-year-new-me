# Project Name : new-year-new-me

## Project goal : 
* To build a non-responsive landing page with HTML and CSS for my new year goal as a web developer. 

## Project Description:

* This is a non-responsive landing page website and best fit for the screen size of 1399*768 (16:9) resolution.

## Used technologies:

* HTML
* CSS

## Challenges I faced: 
* First time I had to flip horizontally the banner image and  text as well. 

## Things I have learnt: 

* There are two ways  to set a background image linear gradients. One – is having a background picture and set gradients. Two – is having to separate images (one image is it self a linear gradient for  example see I set in new-year-new-me project) and  set together then use background-blend-mode property.
* To flip element horizontally I need to use transform: scaleX(-1)
